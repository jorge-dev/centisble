# Development Guidelines

These guidelines are intended to help you contribute to the Centsible project effectively. Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and quality in the codebase.

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Use `gofmt` to format your code. This ensures that all code follows a consistent style.
- Use `goimports` to manage imports and format your code.

### Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variable names and function parameters.
- Use `PascalCase` for type names and exported functions.
- Use `ALL_CAPS` for constants.

### Comments

- Use comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially for complex logic.
- Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.
- Document exported functions and types with comments that start with the name of the function or type.

### Error Handling

- Always check for errors and handle them appropriately.
- Return errors to the caller rather than logging them directly in the function.
- Use `fmt.Errorf` to wrap errors with additional context.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all functions and methods.
- Use the `testing` package for writing tests.
- Name test functions with the prefix `Test` followed by the name of the function being tested.

### Integration Tests

- Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components.
- Use the `testing` package and `httptest` package for writing integration tests.
- Name test functions with the prefix `Test` followed by the name of the feature being tested.

### Running Tests

- Run all tests before submitting a pull request.
- Use the `go test ./...` command to run all tests in the project.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all exported functions, types, and variables.
- Use comments to explain the purpose and usage of the code.

### API Documentation

- Use Swagger to document the API endpoints.
- Update the `openApi.yaml` file with any changes to the API.

### Project Documentation

- Update the `README.md` file with any changes to the project setup or usage.
- Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with any changes to the contribution guidelines.

## Version Control

### Branching

- Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
- Name branches with a prefix that indicates the type of change (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`).

### Commit Messages

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Include a brief description of the change and the reason for the change.

### Pull Requests

- Create a pull request for each feature or bug fix.
- Include a description of the change and the reason for the change.
- Link to any relevant issues or discussions.

## Security

### Input Validation

- Validate all input from external sources.
- Use appropriate validation libraries and techniques to ensure data integrity.

### Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
- Secure all endpoints that require authentication with middleware.

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the database.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration values.

## Deployment

### Docker

- Use Docker to containerize the application.
- Update the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files with any changes to the application setup.

### Continuous Integration

- Use GitHub Actions or another CI tool to automate building, testing, and deployment.
- Ensure that all tests pass before deploying the application.

### Monitoring and Logging

- Use structured logging with a tool like `logrus`.
- Set up monitoring and alerting for important metrics (e.g., API response times, error rates).

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that the Centsible project remains consistent, maintainable, and secure. Thank you for your contributions!
